    Q1) Make sure you have read Web Science: A Provocative Invitation to Computer Science (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. (see also Week 3: Reader on BlackBoard). What examples of negative aspects of Web-based social interaction does Shneiderman mention? Do you share his view that these topics should be seen as part of Web Science? Or are these topics better left to existing research fields as sociology or law? Motivate your answer.
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Shneiderman mentions security breaches, identity theft, privacy violations
    , and the social discruptions of globalization as negative aspects of the web.
    He mentions that the web produces such dangers because it provides chances 
    for hate and terrorism. I believe that these topics are in fact part of 
    web science and thus should be studied. That is not to say that other fields
    such as psychology or law should not study them either, however web science 
    should be interested in how the web is developing. One of the most interesting 
    side effects of the web is how extremists are able to find each other. Far right 
    and far left groups can find like minded individuals on the other side of the 
    globe whereas they would not find them without the internet. Because this could 
    not happen without the web, it should be studied under Web Science.

    Q2) Explain what the term the long tail refers to in the context of web commerce. Most brick-and-mortar shops of books, games and music are forced to focus and sell only a few best-selling products. Why can the long tail still be profitable for online shops?
    </dt>
    <dd>
     The long tail refers to the total revenue of web stores, most of the revenue is 
     in the "long tail", these are stores which perhaps don't sell the most 
     popular item on the web, but because of their reach to interested people on the web
     manage to make a living. Whilst traditional stores must focus only on a few 
     best selling products, online stores can focus on a specific group, charge a 
     high price, and still find those consumers who are willing to pay that price.
     Take for example the Gamebuino product (https://gamebuino.com/), a customizable
     game console aimed at tinkering hobbyists. A traditional store would not be able to 
     sell this product succesfully, but this online store can charge a high price and 
     still find consumers willing to pay for it.

        Q3)
        <ol>
            <li>Define net neutrality</li>
            <li>Do you agree with the statements in favor of net neutrality of Sir Tim in this video, or with the arguments against it from the FCC? Give arguments for our position</li>
            <li>How might this FCC ruling in the USA affect internet consumers in the EU? </li>
        </ol>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Net Neutrality is the principle of treating all web traffic equally </li>
            <li>I am a strong proponent of Net Neutrality. I believe that the reason why the web 
                has thrived so well is due to it's anarchist architecture. The web 
                is a powerful machine built for todays capitalist society. It relies 
                on fair competition, and the reason why it has grown so much is due to 
                this very same competition. If we were to abandon to principle of 
                Net Neutrality we risk technological monopolies to grow even larger 
                than they are today. After all, if Comcast would offer an internet 
                package with super fast YouTube access, Vimeo and other video 
                platforms would suffer and eventually die out. This would leave YouTube
                with the market all to themselves.
            </li>
            <li>The FCC's rulings sets a dangerous precedent for governments all around 
                the globe to do the same. However a more immediate threat to the European 
                consumer stems from the fact that a lot of web businesses are based in 
                the USA. As the FCC's rulings could harm them (especially the smaller ones)
                it could harm the European consumer's access to them.
            </li>
        </ol>

    Q4) Explain the role of data.gov in the discussion about a more transparent government. What could be a potential danger of sites like data.gov? (if you prefer, you can instead answer the same questions about the Dutch data.overheid.nl.
    </dt>
    <dd>
    The role of sites such as data.gov is a double edged sword in the discussion 
    on a more transparent government. On one hand it makes the government much 
    more transparent by literally sharing their information with citizens, but on 
    the other hand the very fact that governments possess this much detailed information 
    could be scary. This also could become a powerful propaganda machine.

    Q5) Jakob Nielsen regularly publishes columns on usability, discussing both good and bad Web design. In a 2011 column he collected his Top 10 Mistakes in Web Design. We are now in 2016, more than five years later. Do you think Nielsen's top 10 is still relevant? From your own experience, do you know of any severe usability problems you encounter on current Web sites that are missing from this list? Which problems in his top 10 have become rare in 2016?
    </dt>
    <dd>
    First of all, we are no longe rin 2016, rather we are in 2019, as such
    it will be interesting to see if these mistakes are still pertinent today.
    Bad Search is rarely a problem nowadays with Google's "did you mean...", but 
    even on other websites, they usually do a good job of search. PDFs are still 
    an issue on the internet, however with today's browsers we are able to still 
    "be in the flow" by opening a PDF in the browser itself. Overall, this list 
    is not pertinent in today's web. Most of the problems no longer occur, or if 
    they do, we have learned to live with it and it no longer annoys us. 
    However I do believe that new usability issues have popped up. First of 
    all, the ad-block pop up that occurs when you visit a site with an ad-blocker 
    turned on. Oftentimes a full page pop-up appears that only goes away if you 
    turn off the ad blocker. However I find that the smaller pop-ups kindly asking 
    you to turn off your ad blocker work better than something that stops me. 
    </dd>

    <dt>
    Q6) Choose an existing website and imagine that you are designing an A/B test to evaluate changes to that website. Discuss the two versions of the site you would want to test, which part of the site you would vary, and how you would measure performance of each version. What would be the dependent and independent variables in your A/B test? What would be your hypothesis?
    </dt>
    <dd>
    The website that I have chosen to evaluate is https://www.tvn24.pl/ a Polish 
    news page which I read daily. However, one thing that has always annoyed me 
    is the fact that they use a proprietary web player instead of embedding it through 
    YouTube, and that their videos Autoplay and have many unskippable ads.
    This is especially annoying when the written article is on top and the 
    autoplaying video is at the bottom of the page. The first 
    version of the site would remain as is, and the second version of the 
    site would have videos without autoplay. The dependent variable is 
    how long users stay on the page, and the independent variable is whether 
    autoplay is on or off. My hypothesis is that articles without autoplay 
    will have a shorter time spent on the page than articles with autoplay videos.
    Although this will theoretically decrease the site's revenue, it will increase 
    the user's experience.
    </dd>

    <dt>
    Q7) Choose an existing web site and build a mini-survey that could appear as a popup on that web site. Explain (briefly) the purpose of your survey, and why you choose to use open questions, yes/no questions and/or questions on a scale (e.g the Likert scale). The html of the survey should work, but obviously it does not need to work on the web site you chose. Include a link to that web site instead.
    </dt>
    <dd>
    The website that we have chosen is <a href = "https://shop.gamebuino.com/en/">The Gamebuino Store</a>. The survey
    wants to understand what visitors would like to see appear on the store.
    We chose to use simple buttons for the user to be able to quickly answer 
    the survey, and hopefully buy something.
    </dd>
    <form>
        What other products would you like us to feature? <br>
        T-shirt Merch
        <input type="checkbox" name = "tshirt"> <br>

    <dt>
    Q8) Explain how the Common Log Format helps developing Web log analysis software. Briefly describe a scenario in which such software is used in an experiment aimed at improving a web site's link structure.
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Web log analysis software is only really possible with a standardized 
    log format such as the Common Log Format. When everybody produces the 
    same logs, we can build software to analyze it. One could use such 
    log data in an experiment looking at whether changing the color of 
    links to red would incresae the number of people clicking on them. 
    First we collect the log data whilst the links aren't red, and then we 
    turn all links red and collect log data. Now we can analyze which version 
    performed better. In this experiment the dependent variable is the number 
    of visitors on the link / number of people who clicked the linked, whilst 
    the independent variable would be the color of links. My hypothesis is that 
    if we change the color of the links to red they will be clicked on more often.
    </dd>

    <dt>
    Q9) The website http://www.archive.org stores old versions of the Web. Use this archive to describe briefly the history of Google or some other site you're interested in. (Expected length: half page)
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Using the Wayback machine provided by the web archive we are able to understand better how certain sites have evolved over the years. We have chosen to look at YouTube.com, a popular video sharing website. The first available snapshot is from 2005, the YouTube home screen is bare due to the interactive section of the website being unavailable through the Wayback machine. We can see that at first the website had a large “Messages” tab, this is a feature which no longer exists on YouTube, instead the platform simply uses email. We can also see that the page is lacking a “Subscriptions” tab, and instead features a “Favorites” tab. This shows how YouTube’s focus has shifted over the years from individual viral videos, something that would be saved under favorites, to following content creators nowadays, something that would fit under subscriptions. This is most likely due to the fact that YouTube was not able to monetize its content as well back in 2005 as it can nowadays, this change lead to the creation of the content creator career. The next snapshot we are looking at comes from 2008. This snapshot features videos on the home page. First of all we can see that the “Favorites” tab has disappeared, but the subscriptions tab does not exist either. The home page has an animated section showing off “Videos being watched right now…” Not only is this animation distracting, it is luckily also absent on today’s YouTube homepage. However, perhaps the most interesting change that we can observe are the videos under the “Featured Videos” section. All of the videos are under 10 minutes and are sporting quite low view numbers. Nowadays most videos on YouTube are longer than 10 minutes in order to be monetized, short videos don’t have advertisements, but longer ones do. Youtubers have found the perfect length to be 10 minutes. The small view numbers represent how YouTube was not quite as popular back in 2008 as it is today. On today’s “Trending” section (equivalent to Featured) videos have close to 1 Million views, a lot more than 2008’s 500 Thousand. To conclude, thanks to the Wayback machine we are able to view YouTube’s evolution. From a small website used to share videos to the behemoth that it is today.

    <dt>
      Q1) Make sure you have read the blog post What Is A Web Server? (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as described in the Week 2: Reader on Blackboard. Knupp states that the GET method is the most common HTTP method. He does not discuss that the HTTP GET method is assumed to be idempotent. Explain
      <ol>
        <li>what idempotent means in this context</li>
        <li>how idempotent requests simplify the implementation of a caching HTTP proxy,</li>
        <li>how so-called "visitor counters" often break this assumption, and</li>
        <li>how such counters might be negatively affected by proxies.</li>
      </ol>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <ol>
        <li>
          An idempotent HTTP method can be performed multiple times with the same
          result being produced. In this context that means that the GET method can
          be called multiple times, with the same result.
        </li>
        <li>
          Idempotent requests, due to their repeating nature, allow for efficient
          caching. As idempotent methods will send out the same data, the proxy
          can cache these requests and get "hits" often.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visitor counters are a display of how many users are visiting a site.
          They can be implemented by tracking the IP address of a request or by
          tracking cookies for instance. Because the state of the web server is
          changing whilst tracking users, it is breaking the assumption of idempotency,
          which would have the server's state remain the same.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proxies could negatively affect visitor counters as they obstruct tracking.
          Users are more hidden, either in a proxy, or in a reverse proxy system.
          This way it is harder to tell how many unique users there are, which is
          the core of a visitor counter
        </li>
      </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>Q2) HTTP is a so-called stateless protocol. Explain what this means. Name at least one advantage and disadvantage of the fact that HTTP is stateless.</dt>
    <dd>
      HTTP is a stateless protocol meaning that each request must carry all of its
      information each time it is sent. The server is not tracking each user, and
      as such cannot associate different requests with a single user. One negative
      of this statelessness is the fact that a user must send a lot of repeating
      information in its requests, such as what browser they are using, all of which
      is increasing the size of a packet. However a positive aspect of this statelessness
      comes from the simplicity that arrives with it. A stateless webserver is much
      simpler to build, and is a lot less complex computationally, than one that would
      track states. Of course using HTTP, we cannot build a stateful web server except by
      using workarounds such as cookies.
    </dd>

    <dt>Q3) One of the first applications of HTTP cookies was to add "shopping basket" functionality to the web sites of online shops. Explain why such sites are hard to build without cookies, and how cookies are used to implement electronic "shopping baskets". (max 100 words)</dt>
    <dd>
      It would be difficult to create a shopping cart which remembers your items
      without cookies. This functionality works so well because we are forcing the
      client's browser to "remember" the shopping cart instead of the server. This
      cuts costs for the online store, as they don't need to store their user's
      items on their servers. Instead, the cookies contain the shopping items that
      are in the user's cart, and each time the user connects to the page, they send
      their shopping cart state (stored in the cookie) to the webserver.
    </dd>

  <dt>Q4) Make a simple (two row by three column) table and summarize briefly what, according to this documentation, the three key REST ingredients are for these two services. Add a fourth column with the three most likely HTTP response codes, along with for each code, a typical situation in which it might occur. </dt>

      <tr>
        <th>Service</th>
        <th>Endpoint</th>
        <th>HTTP method</th>

        <td>The URL to get an album GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/{id} ,
        the documentation page states that there are 3 parameters, authorization,
        which contains an API key, id, which contains the id for a Spotify album,
        and finally market, an optional parameter which contains the user's location
        used for track relinking when an album is not available.</td>
        <td>The HTTP method for a request is GET</td>
        <td>The response, on success sends a status code 200, and returns a JSON
        file with information on the album such as genre or what artists made the music.</td>
        <td>200: OK, request successful. <br> <br> 403: Forbidden, the server understands the
        request but cannot allow you to execute it (Trying to delete an album for example) <br> <br>

        <td>The URL: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/place.json, There are two
        parameters, the first is id, this is the physical location which is used
        to return local trends. This location must be stored as Yahoo! Where On Earth
        Ids. The second paramter is exclude, this parameter accepts a hashtag to
        exclude from trends.</td>
        <td>The HTTP method for a request is GET</td>
        <td>The response is a JSON file containing a list of the top 50 trending
        hashtags. The name, url, promoted content, query term, and tweet volume

        <td>200: OK, request succesful <br> <br> 304: Not modified, there was no new data

  </dd>

  <dt>Q5) Use the REST client of your choice to make an HTTP OPTIONS request to the resource used in assignment 1 and 2: http://wt.ops.labs.vu.nl/api19/????????. Study the HTTP response headers in the server's response you receive back. According to these response headers, which other HTTP requests methods are also allowed on this resource? And from which origin are you allowed to make these requests?</dt>
  <dd>
    Using Postman to send an OPTIONS request to the VU webserver results in 8 headers
    being returned. Of those headers Access-Control-Allow-Methods tells us what
    other HTTP requests are allowed on this resource. In our case the body of that
    header tells us we can use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS on this resource.
    The other header of interest to us is Access-Control-Allow-Origin which tells us
    from which origin we are allowed to make these requests. As the body of the header
    is *, this means that we can request it from any origin.
  </dd>

  <dt>Q6) Use your REST client to make a normal GET request to the same resource (URL) you used above. What is the actual Content-Type of the response? Is it what you expected it to be? Explain your answer.</dt>
  <dd>
    The content-type of the response is application/json, although its hard for me
    to say what the application part of that means, the json was expected. This is
    due to the fact that the resulting data is stored in the JSON format, which is
    also sent to us when using the GET method.
  </dd>

  <dt>Q7) How can you see that your code is indeed reloaded after you made a change in "hello.py"? What happens if you accidentally introduce a syntax error?</dt>
  <dd>
    We can see that the code is indeed reloaded after we make a change to our file
    by changing the contents of the hello world statement. For example getting rid of
    the exclemation mark in the string, saving the file, and reloading the page, shows
    a simple "Hello World" with no "!" Introducing a syntax error such as a mistyped
    return statement (retur) closes the python script session and doesnt try to restart it.
  </dd>

  <dt>Q8) List at least one key advantage of each approach, that is, an HTTP server serving database data dynamically in an HTML table versus one that serves the same data in JSON format.</dt>
  <dd>
    An HTTP Server serving database data dynamically in an HTML table is nice because
    we don't need to wrap the data in HTML tags later down the road (client side). However
    the database itself looks and is more complicated than before, we are mixing up
    code with data. As such the JSON method is nice because the data and the code/tags
    are clearly separated.

  <h1>Lab4</h1>
  <dl>
      <dt>
        Q1.a) Have a closer look at the term frequency matrix. Given this table, how well do you think the tokenizer did its job? Do you see any room for improvement?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A quick look at the term frequency matrix shows a promising, yet non-perfect
           table. Certain words such as "a" are perfectly caught, and the matrix shows
            the expected high frequency for such a word. However we can also see "words"
            such as "_i_", "0", and "3" which do not seem to be correct "words" for any
            analysis. The numbers seem to be outliers, mentioned only once or twice in the book.
            However it is hard to say whether or not this is wrong. After all, those
            numbers did appear in the book. As such, should they be in the frequency
            table? Personally I would say yes, as "real" words such as "accidentally"
            also appear in the book only once, and I would not sort them out as simply
            an outlier. However, the "_i_" seems to be a mistake. As such, the term
            frequency matrix seems to be working correctly, with exception to the
            seemingly special character "_i_".
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Q1.b) Looking at the top 30, does it make sense to include all of them in the stop words list? Explain your answer.
      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          "Stop Words" are a group of words that are so common, and carry little enough meaning
          that something like a natural language processor usually ignors them.
          In the case of the top 30 words in "Alice in Wonderland", some words
            this criteria, however others carry too much importance. For example
            words such as "the", "and", or "a" are simply too common, and carry
            so little meaning, that they perfectly fit the category of a "stop word."
            However common words such as "alice" are important because they carry
            a strong meaning. "alice" refers to one specific character, and this is
            important if one were to understand the text. As such, the top 30 Words
            do not all fit in the "stop words" category, however, most of them do.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>
        Q1.c) Looking at the top 30, do you think the frequency follows Zipf’s law? You can run z-&lt; zipf(alice_index$total) to find out. Explain in your own words what "following Zipf’s law" means in this case.
      </dt>

      <dd>
          <q>Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word number n has a frequency proportional to 1/n.</q>

         <p>
          If we use the above definition of Zipf's law, in order for Alice in Wonderland
          to fit Zipf's law, the top 30 words should have a frequencies proportional to around 1/30
        </p>
        <p>
          By looking at the top 30 words we can see an exponential decrease in the
          frequency of the words. Most notably the quick dropoff from "the" to "and"
          As such, we believe that this text follows Zipf's law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running the given command, we can see that a straight-ish line is formed
          showing the relationship between frequency and rank. As such the text loosely
          follows zipf's law.
        </p>
      </dd>

    <dt>
      Q1.d) Similarly, run h &lt;- heaps(alice_index$total) to determine whether Heaps law applies. Explain in your own words what "Heaps’ law applies" means in this case.
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <q>[Heap's Law] is an empirical law which describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length</q>

      <p>
        Heap's law, in this case, would mean that as we search through Alice in Wonderland
        we will find more and more distinct vocabulary terms (new words). Or, in other words,
        how many new words would exist in the book, should it have been made longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running the given command shows a graph showing the relationship between
        input tokens (text length) and dictionary size (number of distinct words in text).
        This graph looks similar to other Heap's law graphs found online, overall the relationship
        looks logarithmic.

      Q2.a) How do you assess the quality of the TF-based search. What can you say about precision and recall?
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        The TF-based search does not seem to work very well. When I searched for
        the quote "Who in the World am I?" the TF search returned over a thousand hits.
        This is obviously incorrect, there were many false positives.
      </p>

      <p>
        The precision of the TF Search is low, the number of true positives
        (maybe one or two times the phrase appears) compared to over a thousand
        false positives tells us the precision is poor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The recall of the TF Search is not too bad, recall is the number of
        true positives over the number of false negatives. As there are only a few
        instances of our test phrase, there aren't many false negatives (we have
        double checked if the quote appears in the hits)
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
      Q2.b) Computing the TFIDF matrix takes quite some time. Why is that, do you think?
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        We believe that the reason why the TFIDF matrix takes so long to compute
        is because of the nature of the inverse document frequency equation. The
        equation used to calculate the TFIDIF matrix is complicated as it contains a
        logarithm, which increases the time to compute the table.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
      Q2.c) Compare the TF-based search with the TFIDF-based search. What has changed? How do you compare the quality of the searches. What can you say about precision and recall?
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        For this exercise we continued to use our main testing phrase "Who in the world am I?"
        from Question 2 part B. TFIDF will rank which chapter our phrase is "rarest" in.
        When running the search, we end up getting results showing Chapter 6 Pig and Pepper
        as the chapter in which our phrase is the rarest, or carries the most meaning in.
        This is a different search from the TF search, and returns different results. TF
        was simply trying to show the frequency, but the TFIDF search tries to encorportate
        rarity and meaning to it as well. This makes words like "a" rank lower.
        This search largely outperforms TF in finding the correct chapter however.
        Our quote appears in chapter 2 of the book, which is the chapter in second place
        using TFIDF search, with a score of 1.43. Meanwhile in the TF search chapter 2
        was ranked 9th.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of precision this search is a lot better than TF, it doesn't have as many
        false positives. More chapters have values of 0, or simply low values.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of recall as well, it is hard to say as the tested phrase only appears once.
        This does not leave much room for false negatives. However, the correct chapter was ranked
        highly in TFIDF, which means that the recall is most likly better than TF.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
      Q2.d) Alice in Wonderland only has 11 chapters, what can you say about the precision at k where k=5 for both types of searches. That is, what if you would only look at the 5 highest ranked results, and discard the other results as irrelevant.
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        If we were to only use the top 5 chapters for precision calculation, TFIDF
        would still rank better. Especially since there are 0 true positives in the TF's
        top 5 results. TFIDF's precision would not change by much.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>
      Q2.e) What would happen to precision and recall if you implemented the improvements to the tokenizer you suggested in question 1a.?
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Implementing the improvements mentioned in Question 1 A would change
        almost nothing in recall and precision for both searches as my improvement
        was pertain to the "_i_", "3", and "0" tokens found. These only appear 4
        times throughout the whole book, and as such carry little impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, an improvement that would increase precision and recall would be to
        include "made up" words or names such as Absolem. Character's names, whilst
        not always in dictionaries, are vital to searches such as these and should
        not be treated as irrelevant. This will decrease the number of false negatives,
        leading to an improved recall, and will also lead to an increase in true positives,
        increasing precision

    <h1>Browser Report for Assignment 1 Website</h1>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two browsers we chose to test our website on was Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The two browsers show the content in a very similar way, however when inputting data into the table, the two browsers have different
        selection methods. When inputting a "Best Before Date" into the table, Google Chrome shows a calendar to select a date, whilst Microsoft Edge shows a scroll wheel selection for the dates. A larger difference is that Google Chrome shows a "up/down"
        button on the input box for "Amount." Other than that the two browsers show the pages as identical.
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Testing our website for different screen sizes on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge was the same. On both browsers we ran into issues with changing the screen size. In general we had issues with using the </p> <code> @media screen and (min-width: 600px) { </code>
    <p>
        selector.
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the two browsers start to change is when testing the print media type. Google Chrome shows everything as we designed it (due to the fact that we used it during development) however Microsoft Edge does not grayscale the
        page. This is strange as we used the modifier </p>
    <code>
				filter: gray;
        filter: grayscale(100%);
			  </code>
    <p>This is under our print media style section. There are more differences in the print styles as well. For example one of the three red stars used in our unordered list under the about section leaks over to the third page in Edge, but stays on the second
        page in Chrome. Red Stars: </p>
    <code>list-style-image: url(https://russianchicagomag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Editor_avatar_1438098395-25x25.jpg);</code>
    <p>While the grayscale modifier isn't that big of a deal, as users can set their printers to grayscale, the red star is annoying, as the actual list element does not show up, only the image.
    </p>


    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end we decided that all of these browser differences did not make much of a difference, as such we decided not to take additional steps to fix them. In the future, one could use more strict css rules to keep the red star
        above the page break. However the grayscale issue on Microsoft Edge is most likely due to the browser simply not supporting it.

            <p>The main difference is that, as for exported HTML, the word processor will automatically generate many other contents or flies like stylesheet and xml. This styling information is used to make the page look exactly as it does in the Word application,
                so that the fonts are the same etc. Meanwhile a regular HTML document created with a plain text editor will not do that.</p>

        <dt>6. Explain why some prefer the the HTML of the first paragraph

            <p>I think it is because &lt;b&gt; only refers to style, which means we use &lt;b&gt; to make the text look bold purely for stylistic reasons. Meanwhile we use &lt;strong&gt; if we wanted that bit of text to look bold and have emphasis. That
                means that &lt;strong&gt; indicates an important piece of information. In other words, &lt;strong&gt; is a semantic tag (carrieis meaning), whilst &lt;b&gt; is not semantic.</p>

            <p>Example: In terms of you looking at the output on a page, there is no visual difference. They look exactly the same. The difference comes with text-to-speech programs, often used by blind people. When blind people look at a website, all the
                text is spoken to them. If you use &lt;b&gt;, the voice program will not do anything differently when reading the text. But if you use &lt;strong&gt;, the voice program might speak the text differently—with emphasis, or in a different
                tone of voice. This is done to convey to the blind person that the text is important in some way. </p>

            <ol>
                <li>CSS can be used to apply style to the whole page or the website without changing much of the core code. The look and layout of a site can be changed beyond recognition just by altering the CSS file;</li>
                <li>This will improved web page download times;</li>
                <li>This allows us to position our element anywhere in the webpage;</li>
                <li>It can help us handle dynamic web design that aims to make sites accessible for various media, by permitting the same markup page to be exhibited in various review styles;</li>
                <li>This allows consistency to all web pages, which means we need not to worry about the change in characteristics of the elements</li>
                <li>This helps us save time as we can reuse css files for multiple html files. For example if each page on our website always shows &lt;h1&gt; tags with a font-family of arial, we can simply link a single css file to each html file instead
                    of editing each html file individually</li>

			</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                The multilingual issues that the web is facing and that the W3C is trying to resolve are plentiful. The root of the issues stem from the fact that languages around the world are all very different. Just because the web started out in English does not
                mean that it should be limited to that one language. After all, how could the web truly be "World Wide" if only one language was involved? Because this is the case many groups, including the W3C aim at involving other languages in the
                web. This is what internationalization refers to. The issues are plenty but we've listed a few here:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Character Sets</b>
                    <div>Whilst the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, this is certainly not the case for other languages. Some alphabetical systems, such as Korean, have a different amount of letters in their alphabet, or some, like Chinese, don't use
                        an alphabetical system, instead consisting of thousands of characters. As such the W3C tasks itself with correctly displaying these foreign characters on the web. This is difficult to do, especially with encorporating fonts and
                        the rest.</div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Reading order</b>
                    <div>In English we read left to right, but in certain languages that is not the case. For example, Japanese is read right to left, or even sometimes top to bottom. This creates problems with displaying this text on websites. By simply using
                        standards meant for the English language this would be difficult, this is why the W3C is interested in standartising bidirectional text.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Time Zones</b>
                    <div>Time zones are a large issue in internationalization as not all countries are in the same time zone. Because of this, when time is displayed on a web app or web page, there is a possibility that it is the incorrect time for a user
                        in a different time zone. There are many ways to address this issue including using floating time. Floating time refers to time that is not tied to a specific time zone. By using this time format we can altogether avoid the issue
                        of time zones. However almost nobody uses a floating time system. As such a better solution could be location service tracking which can convert between time zones in order to always display the correct time. This is what is used
                        most commonly nowadays.</div>

			</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Main features of IPv6:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <div>Larger Address Space</div>
                            In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 uses 4 times more bits to address a device on the Internet. This much of extra bits can provide approximately 3.4×1038 different combinations of addresses. This address can accomodate the aggressive requirement of address allotment
                            for almost everything in this world. According to an estimate, 1564 addresses can be allocated to every square meter of this earth.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Simplified Header</div>
                            IPv6’s header has been simplified by moving all unnecessary information and options (which are present in IPv4 header) to the end of the IPv6 header. IPv6 header is only twice as big as IPv4 provided the fact that IPv6 address is four times longer.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Auto-configuration</div>
                            IPv6 supports both stateful and stateless auto configuration mode of its host devices. This way, the absence of a DHCP server does not put a halt on inter segment communication.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Faster Forwarding/Routing</div>
                            Simplified header puts all unnecessary information at the end of the header. The information contained in the first part of the header is adequate for a Router to take routing decisions, thus making routing decision quickly as it only looks at the important
                            part of the header.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>IPSec</div>
                            Initially it was decided that IPv6 must have IPSec security, making it more secure than IPv4. This feature has now been made optional.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>No Broadcast</div>
                            Though Ethernet/Token Ring are considered as broadcast network because they support Broadcasting, IPv6 does not have any broadcast support any more. It uses multicast to communicate with multiple hosts.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Anycast Support</div>
                            This is another characteristic of IPv6. IPv6 has introduced Anycast mode of packet routing. In this mode, multiple interfaces over the Internet are assigned the same Anycast IP address. Routers, whilst routing, send the packet to the nearest destination.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Mobility</div>
                            IPv6 was designed to keep mobility in mind. This feature enables hosts (such as mobile phones) to roam around in different geographical areas and remain connected with the same IP address. The mobility feature of IPv6 takes advantage of auto IP configuration
                            and Extension headers.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Enhanced Priority Support</div>
                            IPv4 used 6 bits DSCP (Differential Service Code Point) and 2 bits ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) to provide Quality of Service but it could only be used if the end-to-end devices support it, that is, the source and destination device and underlying
                            network must support it. In IPv6, Traffic class and Flow label are used to tell the underlying routers how to efficiently process the packet and route it.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Smooth Transition</div>
                            Large IP address scheme in IPv6 enables us to allocate devices with globally unique IP addresses. This mechanism saves IP addresses and NAT is not required. So devices can send/receive data amongst each other, for example, VoIP and/or any streaming media
                            can be used much efficiently. The other fact is that the header is less loaded, so routers can take forwarding decisions and forward them much faster.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div>Extensibility</div>
                            One of the major advantages of IPv6 header is that it is extensible, meaning it is possible to add more information in the option part of the packet. IPv4 provides only 40-bytes for options, whereas options in IPv6 can be as much as the size of IPv6 packet
                            itself.

                    <p>The reasons of moving from version 4 to version 6:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Publicly available IPv4 addresses have been exhausted.</li>
                        <li>Technological innovation has become the key to business success in the 21st century, so IPv6 is necessary for business growth.</li>
                        <li>Unlike an IPv4 network in which fragmentation is handled by the router, source devices handle fragmentation in an IPv6 network and they are also responsible for discovering the paths maximum transmission unit. So, by reducing the
                            size of routing tables, IPv6 makes routing more efficient and hierarchical. ISPs can aggregate the prefixes of their customers networks into a single prefix that they can announce to the IPv6 Internet. </li>
                        <li>Unlike IPv4, IP-level checksum is not included in IPv6, the new Internet Protocol can handle packets more efficiently and deliver better performance.</li>
                        <li>In IPv6, multicast entirely replaces broadcast. This makes multicast an integrated and necessary function of an IPv6 network. The benefit to this is that multicast saves network bandwidth by allowing bandwidth-intensive packet
                            flows to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously. While, in IPv4, IPv4, multicast was primarily used to deliver multimedia on IPv4 networks. </li>

                <dt>10. Most of the well-known HTTP web servers serve HTML and other content to end users. But behind the scenes,
				there are many HTTP servers that provide services for other web sites. To manage who is allowed to do what on these services, they often deploy keys: short sequences of characters that are used to uniquely identify you. We will use an example of such a web site in the assignments, for which your need a key. So please go the page at https://wt.ops.labs.vu.nl/keys and generate a key. Please record the value of the key generated as the answer to this question, so you can use it later in the assignments.
