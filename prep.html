		<h1>Browser Report for Assignment 1 Website</h1>
		<p>		The two browsers we chose to test our website on was Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
			The two browsers show the content in a very similar way, however when inputting data
			into the table, the two browsers have different selection methods. When inputting a
			"Best Before Date" into the table, Google Chrome shows a calendar to select a date,
			whilst Microsoft Edge shows a scroll wheel selection for the dates. A larger difference is
			that Google Chrome shows a "up/down" button on the input box for "Amount." Other than that
			the two browsers show the pages as identical.
		</p>

		<p>
				Where the two browsers start to change is when testing the print media type. Google Chrome
				shows everything as we designed it (due to the fact that we used it during development)
				however Microsoft Edge does not grayscale the page. This is strange as we used the modifier
				<code>filter: gray;
        filter: grayscale(100%);</code> This is under our print media style section. There are more
				differences in the print styles as well. For example one of the three red stars used in our
				unordered list under the about section leaks over to the third page in Edge, but stays on the second
				page in Chrome. Red Stars: <code>list-style-image: url(https://russianchicagomag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Editor_avatar_1438098395-25x25.jpg);</code>
				While the grayscale modifier isn't that big of a deal, as users can set their printers to
				grayscale, the red star is annoying, as the actual list element does not show up, only the image.

  			<dt>1. What is the key difference between the HTML5
				Recommendation published by W3C and the one
				published by the WHATWG?
			</dt>
  				<dd>
					<p> The key difference is their original HTML5 Recommendation. WHATWG regard HTML5 as a
					highly sef-contained platform or even as a fast,
					general-purpose computer with its own operating system,
					while W3C wants to standardise every possible element or
					operations in HTML5 and that's why
					the W3C’s HTML5 standard is super long.</p>
					<p>
						All in all, the W3C sees HTML5 as a single
						static version document, while for WHATWG, it is living
						and dynamic.
					</p>
				</dd>

  			<dt>2. Explain the difference between "the Internet"
				and "the World-Wide Web". Provide links to the
				online resources you used (if any) to answer
				this question.
			</dt>
		  		<dd>
					<cite>
					"The Internet is a comprehensive network of computers and was
					conceptualized during 1969 by the ARPA or Advanced Research Projects Agency.
					The World Wide Web is much newer compared to the Internet and was initialized
					during the 1990s. The World Wide Web is a collection of web pages following
					the http protocol that can be accessed via the Internet from any part of the
					world."<a href="https://www.theedesign.com/blog/2006/differences-between-the-internet-and-world-wide-web">
					<small>sourse</small></a>
					</cite>
					<p>
						Or, in our own words: The internet is a connected network of computer systems using TCP/IP.
						The world wide web is built on top of the internet and is a space where documents
						can be identified with URIs and can be hyperlinked together.
					</p>


				</dd>

			<dt>3. What are the three essential technologies that
				Tim Berners-Lee created to build the World-Wide
				Web on top of the already existing Internet infrastructure?
			</dt>
		  		<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language.
							The markup (formatting) language for the web.</li>
						<li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
							that is unique and used to identify to each resource
							on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
						<li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
							retrieval of linked resources from across the web, is responsible
							for receiving and requesting data through connections.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

			<dt>4. Create a document with the text "Hello World!"
				in a word processor such as Microsoft Word or
				LibreOffice Writer. Save the file as a Web page
				or HTML document and inspect the HTML source using
				a plain text editor or a browser. Describe the key
				differences of the exported HTML against a regular
				HTML document created with a plain text editor.
				</dt>
		  		<dd><p>The main difference is that, as for exported HTML,
					the word processor will automatically generate many
					other contents or flies like stylesheet and xml. This styling information is
				  used to make the page look exactly as it does in the Word application,
					so that the fonts are the same etc.
					Meanwhile a regular HTML document created with a plain
					text editor will not do that.</p>
					For example, the code below is generated by Microsoft Word:

			<dt>6. Explain why some prefer the the HTML of the first paragraph
				over the second, and give an example where this could be important.
				Also, identify another pair of HTML constructs for which
				the same rationale holds.
			</dt>
		  		<dd><p>I think it is because &lt;b&gt; only refers to style,
					which means we use &lt;b&gt; to make the text look bold purely for
					stylistic reasons. Meanwhile we use &lt;strong&gt; if we wanted that
					bit of text to look bold and have emphasis. That means
					that &lt;strong&gt; indicates an important piece of information.
					In other words, &lt;strong&gt; is a semantic tag (carrieis meaning),
					whilst &lt;b&gt; is not semantic.</p>

					<p>Example: In terms of you looking at the output on a page,
					there is no visual difference. They look exactly the same.
					The difference comes with text-to-speech programs, often used by
					blind people. When blind people look at a website, all the text
					is spoken to them. If you use &lt;b&gt;, the voice program will not
					do anything differently when reading the text. But if you use
					&lt;strong&gt;, the voice program might speak the text
					differently—with emphasis, or in a different tone of voice.
					This is done to convey to the blind person that the text is
					important in some way. </p>

			<dt>7. Identify one similarity and one difference between

			<dt>8. List potential benefits of using CSS over
				HTML style markup.
			</dt>
		  		<dd>
					<ol>
						<li>CSS can be used to apply style to the whole page or the website
							without changing much of the core code. The look and layout of a
							site can be changed beyond recognition just by altering the
							CSS file;</li>
						<li>This will improved web page download times;</li>
						<li>This allows us to position our element anywhere in the webpage;</li>
						<li>It can help us handle dynamic web design that aims to make sites
							accessible for various media, by permitting the same
							markup page to be exhibited in various review styles;</li>
						<li>This allows consistency to all web pages, which means we need not to
							worry about the change in characteristics of the elements</li>
						<li>This helps us save time as we can reuse css files for multiple
						html files. For example if each page on our website always shows
						&lt;h1&gt; tags with a font-family of arial, we can simply link a single
						css file to each html file instead of editing each html file individually</li>

			<dt>9. How would you expect a Web browser to render an emphasized word

					<li>Apple Safari</li>
					<li>Google Chrome (or Chromium on Debian Linux)</li>
					<li>Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer</li>
					<li>Mozilla Firefox (or Iceweasel on Debian Linux)</li>

						<li>Default style sheet</li>
						<li>Loading speed (browsing performance)</li>
						<li>User interface</li>
						<li>Customization options</li>
					</ol>
					If we take choose Apple's Safari, and Google's Chrome the differences are as follow
					<ol>
						<li>Safari and Chrome's radio buttons differ in style</li>
						<li>Safari is a lot more optimized, and as such faster and less ram heavy, than Chrome</li>
						<li>Safari has a cleaner look than Chrome</li>

				5. Summarize the key multilingual issues that W3C (Links to an external site.)
				Links to an external site. is addressing within the "Internationalization" activity.
			</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						The multilingual issues that the web is facing and that the W3C is
						trying to resolve are plentiful. The root of the issues stem from
						the fact that languages around the world are all very different. Just
						because the web started out in English does not mean that it should be
						limited to that one language. After all, how could the web truly be
						"World Wide" if only one language was involved? Because this is the case
						many groups, including the W3C aim at involving other languages in the web.
						This is what internationalization refers to. The issues are plenty but we've
						listed a few here:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Character Sets</b></li>
						<p>
						Whilst the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, this is certainly
						not the case for other languages. Some alphabetical systems, such as Korean,
						have a different amount of letters in their alphabet, or some, like Chinese,
						don't use an alphabetical system, instead consisting of thousands of characters.
						As such the W3C tasks itself with correctly displaying these foreign
						characters on the web. This is difficult to do, especially with encorporating
						fonts and the rest.
						</p>
						<li><b>Reading order</b></li>
						<p>
						In English we read left to right, but in certain languages that is
						not the case. For example, Japanese is read right to left, or even sometimes
						top to bottom. This creates problems with displaying this text on websites.
						By simply using standards meant for the English language this would be difficult,
						this is why the W3C is interested in standartising bidirectional text.
						</p>
						<li><b>Time Zones</b></li>
						<p>
						Time zones are a large issue in internationalization as not all countries
						are in the same time zone. Because of this, when time is displayed on
						a web app or web page, there is a possibility that it is the incorrect
						time for a user in a different time zone. There are many ways to address
						this issue including using floating time. Floating time refers to time
						that is not tied to a specific time zone. By using this time format
						we can altogether avoid the issue of time zones. However almost nobody
						uses a floating time system. As such a better solution could be location
						service tracking which can convert between time zones in order to always
						display the correct time. This is what is used most commonly nowadays.
						</p>

				7. Look up information about the new protocol for IP addresses (IPv6, IP version 6).
				Describe the main features of this protocol and indicate what the reasons are to
				move from version 4 to version 6.
			</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Main features of IPv6:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><div>Larger Address Space</div>
							In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 uses 4 times more bits to address a
							device on the Internet. This much of extra bits can provide
							approximately 3.4×1038 different combinations of addresses.
							This address can accomodate the aggressive requirement of address
							allotment for almost everything in this world. According to an
							estimate, 1564 addresses can be allocated to every square meter
							of this earth.</li>
						<li><div>Simplified Header</div>
							IPv6’s header has been simplified by moving all unnecessary information
							and options (which are present in IPv4 header) to the end of the IPv6 header.
							IPv6 header is only twice as big as IPv4 provided the fact that IPv6 address
							is four times longer.</li>
						<li><div>Auto-configuration</div>
							IPv6 supports both stateful and stateless auto configuration mode of its host
							devices. This way, the absence of a DHCP server does not put a halt on inter
							segment communication.</li>
						<li><div>Faster Forwarding/Routing</div>
							Simplified header puts all unnecessary information at the end of the header.
							The information contained in the first part of the header is adequate for a
							Router to take routing decisions, thus making routing decision quickly as
							it only looks at the important part of the header.</li>
						<li><div>IPSec</div>
							Initially it was decided that IPv6 must have IPSec security, making it more secure
							than IPv4. This feature has now been made optional.</li>
						<li><div>No Broadcast</div>
							Though Ethernet/Token Ring are considered as broadcast network because they support
							Broadcasting, IPv6 does not have any broadcast support any more. It uses multicast
							to communicate with multiple hosts.</li>
						<li><div>Anycast Support</div>
							This is another characteristic of IPv6. IPv6 has introduced Anycast mode of packet routing.
							In this mode, multiple interfaces over the Internet are assigned the same Anycast
							IP address. Routers, whilst routing, send the packet to the nearest destination.</li>
						<li><div>Mobility</div>
							IPv6 was designed to keep mobility in mind. This feature enables hosts (such as mobile phones)
							to roam around in different geographical areas and remain connected with the same
							IP address. The mobility feature of IPv6 takes advantage of auto IP configuration
							and Extension headers.</li>
						<li><div>Enhanced Priority Support</div>
							IPv4 used 6 bits DSCP (Differential Service Code Point) and 2 bits ECN
							(Explicit Congestion Notification) to provide Quality of Service but it
							could only be used if the end-to-end devices support it, that is, the
							source and destination device and underlying network must support it.
							In IPv6, Traffic class and Flow label are used to tell the underlying
							routers how to efficiently process the packet and route it.</li>
						<li><div>Smooth Transition</div>
							Large IP address scheme in IPv6 enables us to allocate devices with globally
							unique IP addresses. This mechanism saves IP addresses and NAT is not required.
							So devices can send/receive data amongst each other, for example, VoIP and/or any
							streaming media can be used much efficiently.
							The other fact is that the header is less loaded, so routers can take forwarding decisions
							and forward them much faster.</li>
						<li><div>Extensibility</div>
							One of the major advantages of IPv6 header is that
							it is extensible, meaning it is possible to add more information
							in the option part of the packet. IPv4 provides only 40-bytes for options,
							whereas options in IPv6 can be as much as the size of IPv6 packet

					<p>The reasons of moving from version 4 to version 6:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Publicly available IPv4 addresses have been exhausted.</li>
						<li>Technological innovation has become the key to business success in the 21st century,
							so IPv6 is necessary for business growth.</li>
						<li>Unlike an IPv4 network in which fragmentation is handled by the router, source devices
							handle fragmentation in an IPv6 network and they are also responsible for
							discovering the paths maximum transmission unit. So, by reducing the size of routing tables,
							IPv6 makes routing more efficient and hierarchical. ISPs can aggregate the prefixes of their customers
							networks into a single prefix that they can announce to the IPv6 Internet. </li>
						<li>Unlike IPv4, IP-level checksum is not included in IPv6, the new Internet Protocol can handle packets more
							efficiently and deliver better performance.</li>
						<li>In IPv6, multicast entirely replaces broadcast. This makes multicast an integrated and necessary function of an IPv6 network.
							The benefit to this is that multicast saves network bandwidth by allowing bandwidth-intensive packet flows to be sent to multiple
							destinations simultaneously. While, in IPv4, IPv4, multicast was primarily used to deliver multimedia on IPv4 networks. </li>

				9. Make sure you have read the blog post What Is A Web Server?
				as described in the Reader on
				Canvas. Knupp states that the GET method is the most common HTTP request
				method. Name at least one other HTTP request method and find out what the
				differences are between GET and the one you picked. Which authoritative
				source(s) have you used?

						<li>Differences between GET and head:
							<p>The HEAD method is identical to GET except that

								The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response
								to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent
								in response to a GET request. </p>

			<dt>10. Most of the well-known HTTP web servers serve HTML and other content to end users. But behind the scenes,
				there are many HTTP servers that provide services for other web sites. To manage who is allowed to do what on these services, they often deploy keys: short sequences of characters that are used to uniquely identify you. We will use an example of such a web site in the assignments, for which your need a key. So please go the page at https://wt.ops.labs.vu.nl/keys and generate a key. Please record the value of the key generated as the answer to this question, so you can use it later in the assignments.
