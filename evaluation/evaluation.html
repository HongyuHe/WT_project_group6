               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our website attempts to provide a great user experience, it has so far managed to do well,
               however, there are possible improvements to make the site more accessible, and more usable
               for users. First of all our page fails to provide alt attributes for all images. It only provides
               them for the static images present on the site and fails to do so for the dynamic table. Second
               of all, whilst the input form of the dynamic table includes many useful placeholder and name tags
               for understanding its purpose, some short text explaining the usage would make the page more accessible.
               Finally, our page is not fully functional through a keyboard alone, the Google Maps and Interactive Widget
               are not accessible. However, we believe that this is not the core functionality of our web page, and as such
               does not merit fixes, especially since they are out of reach. We worked hard to make the page as intuitive as
               possible which allowed us to make the page highly usable. One example of this is in the different colored Edit,
               Delete, and Submit buttons. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that one of the most important WCAG guidelines for our web page to follow is Guideline
                1.3.1 "Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation
                can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A)" In order to fulfill this guideline 
                we used semantic tags throughout our web page such as &lt;abbr&gt; in order to convey the relationships 
                and meaning of text on our website. We also carefully used the header and section tags in order to properly 
                sequence our web page. This decision also lead to a more accessible and usable site. We also believe that 
                Guideline 2.4.4 "Link Purpose (In Context): The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone
                or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the
                link would be ambiguous to users in general. (Level A)" is especially important for accessibility. We strived 
                hard to meet this guideline by using a navigation bar for most of our links. However during this self evaluation 
                report we realized that we had a link under our "Physical Locations" table which did not have a clear purpose. 
                The link leads to a Krakow Post article explaining how stores in Poland are closed on Sundays. However, we should 
                make this link much more clean and make the purpose more clear. This can be accomplished with special accessiblity tags.
                We also believe that this change will better the overall usability of our site. Finally, we believe that Guideline 
                1.4.1 "Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting
                a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)" is an important accessibility guideline. If this site were 
                to be live for store employees we must prepare the site to be as accessible as possible to employees with disabilities.
                As one of the most common disabilities is color blindness, this guideline is especially important. As such we took 
                steps in order to make the page as eye pleasing as possible, whilst still being accessible to these people. This means that 
                all of our interactive elements do not only use color as a means to convey information. Our page uses shapes, correct 
                tags, and contrasting colors in order to comply with this guideline. Our web page conforms, and also does not conform to 
                other guidelines found under Appendix A.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to improve our website in specific ways in order to improve its accessibility and usability. The following is our
                prioritized list of improvements to make, from most important to least. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Fix the Krakow Post link in order to make it's purpose more clear. In order to accomplish this we will 
                    add an &lt;abbr&gt; tag around the link, explaining the purpose of the link. [Guideline 2.4.4]
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide alt attributes for the images missing them (ie. in the dynamic table). In order to make the dynamic table's images 
                    have alt attributes, we will simply make the alt text the products name. In the future one could add an additional column 
                    asking for alt text. However we believe this to be outside the scope for this assignment. [Guideline 1.1.1]
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will make only the last row refresh when adding a new product to the table. This will be done in javascript
                    by simply adding a row to the HTML table instead of building the whole table again. This will improve the user's 
                    experience. [Assignment 2 Reset Button]
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will change how our form stops users from submitting incomplete forms. Currently our page grays out the submit button 
                    when it detects an incomplete input field. This however, our TA pointed out to be unintuitive and could be confusing. 
                    As such in the improved implementation we will get rid of the grayed out submit button and replace it with a Javascript 
                    alert. This will be done using Javascript's alert() function. [Assignment 2 Misc.]
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to make our code cleaner we will merge dynamic_table.js and sort_table.js into one file. This should not be complicated 
                    [Assignment 2 Misc.]
